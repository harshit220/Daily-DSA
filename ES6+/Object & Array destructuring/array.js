//map, forEach, filter, reduce
//Higher order functions
//These properties/methods are works with arrays only.

//map gives us a new array.
//ForEach doesnt return anything.

var arr = [13, 9, 46, 33, 7, 90, 21];

//newArr = arr.forEach(a=>a+10)




//filter is just takes in a condition//condition is true it returns

//newArr = arr.filter((a,i)=>a>2);




//Array creates in a many ways

var arr1 = new Array(3).fill(6);
var arr1 = new Array(1, 2, 3)
console.log(arr1)


//Diff between arrays & objects
//arrays have index values pairs. // are special types of objects// another object//
//Objects have key valus pairs
console.log(typeof arr === typeof{})



//2d arrays, mxn
// Transpose of an array. mxn-> nxm
